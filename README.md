# SpamPatrick

SpamPatrick is a script that uses the email form on Patrick O'Boyle's website ([http://patrickoboyle.com/](http://patrickoboyle.com/)) to send him an email every *random number between 1 and 11* seconds.

It picks a random name, company and email suffix from some long lists.

To run:
```
./spampatrick.sh
```
