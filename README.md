# SpamPatrick

SpamPatrick is a python script that uses the email form on Patrick O'Boyle's website ([http://patrickoboyle.com/](http://patrickoboyle.com/)) to send him an email every *random number between 1 and 11* seconds.

It picks a random name, company and email suffix from some long lists.

The message it sends is this:
```
Hi Patrick,
I am a recruiter for our UI team here at COMPANY in Dublin. I was wondering if you would like to meet up for a coffee to discuss possible employment opportunities here at COMPANY. If so, please let me know when you're free.
Kind regards,
NAME, EMEA University recruiter
